# 1) Google is your number 1 friend

Everyone needs Google to solve their problems so don't think you are an exception. Don't be afraid to Google. I needed to do a multitude of searches even to prove my skills and access code wars at all!

# 2) Take a break

If you are stuck on a kata for more than an hour don't keep bashing away. Make sure you have had a good Google search. If you are feeling frustrated, take a break, post a question on Stack Overflow  and possibly about the code or give another kata a try for a while. You never know when the correct answer might come to you. Coming down to a Founders and Coders meetup is a fantastic way to get help too.

# 3) Go hunting

Don't just pick up the first kata that you see. Check for kata that are targeted by a lot of people and/or those that have many up votes.

Have a look at a few before committing yourself. Some are better designed than others and the level of difficulty varies a fair bit too!

# 4) Don't be afraid to post kata

Designing and posting your own kata can help you to understand how Code wars works and will also help to boost your points. In many cases the easier kata can gain you the most points. So don't be shy because you think your kata are too easy.

# 5) Come to a Founders and Coders meetup

Founders and Coders run two meetups: every monday is Coding for Everyone whilst Coding for Women occurs on Tuesdays fortnightly. You are sure to find plenty of other people working on Code Wars at either meet up that can help you finish those troublesome kata.
