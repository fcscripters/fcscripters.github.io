After travelling the world and the seven seas there lies only one path ahead for the mighty Tor, the realm of the unknown, the space that operates in only matter the place where only some men have been before, cyber space!! 

After many a night locked away in a dark and mysterious bothy I would begin to enter the world of code. The 0's and 1's the dots and dashes would send Tormod into a haze of confusion but provide intrigue of great magnitude. Tinkering away on static sites I decided to venture to greener pastures and started attendeding the Founders & Coders Meetup. This experience proved invaluable, speaking with various other would be coders of all different levels I learnt of the F&C's academy. The buzz and energy in the room was comparable to a live set by the Chemical brothers in garden shed. I knew right away I wanted a bit of the action. 

e.g. Various tinker tonker Tormod projects before F&C's can be found on my personal site.

The first week has started with much nerves and anticipation with everyone holding there cards close to their chests as they enter a room full of like minded individuals all enthusiatic to learn but weary of embarrassment.

From day one there was no rest for the wicked diving straight in with the challenge of developing an application in groups of four starting from scratch. This was the beginning of the end the start of the armaggeddon only of Nostradamus could have seen this one, it was the birth of the fcscripters - Tormod, Sohil, Gethin, and Conor. 

By the end of the week the young chaps with the assistance of their fellow cohorts had managed to compile carious README files instructing on the us of GIT, CSS, and project management. Following this mountain they created a css grid and finally a blog page of which you are reading using Jekyll, gh-pages and sass. This challenge proved to be monstrous but nothing the Scripters couldn't tame.

#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
