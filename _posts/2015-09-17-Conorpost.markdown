So far the the founders and coders course has been a fascinating experience. I hope the keep everyone updated with my progress on the this blog. So far we have had 4 days at founders and coders.


Day one started of with a eye opening memory game to introduce us to each other. Then we got stuck into our first task, where we had to create an online form using Javascript HTML  and CSS. One thing i noticed straight away was how different it was working in a group of 4 as opposed to on your own or in pairs, we had to be much more careful about following the correct workflow in Github, so much of the exercise was dedicated to this.


Day two kicked off with a task which had been emailed to us that morning and some of the students had come in early to get started. The task was to create a library in html and css which would produce a grid. At the end of the time allowed me and my partner had had some difficulty in creating the columns to match up with the rows. A handful of the the pairs then presented the libraries they had managed to create. The next task was to select a topic from a list and create a Readme document for this topic. A Readme explains a topic or project, generally covering What How and Why. this was a great opportunity for me and my partner to research a topic which could also help us solve the problem we had been having with the morning task. With this in mind we chose to create a read for Developer tools in the Chrome browser, to see the result click here [I'm an inline-style link](https://github.com/FAC6/book/blob/master/patterns/week1/ChromeDevToolsREADME.md). The day was topped off with a talk about raising your online profile as a developer, given Nelson.


Day three was when we were introduce to this weeks project. The plan was to create a blog website in our groups. we were given until Friday morning to complete the task, then after we would have to present our work and have a code review. The task was to be completed using Jekyll which creates a template file structure for your HTML and CSS. We spent a good amount of time learning how to set up Jekyll and its basics. By the end of the day we had an up and running website with a home page and separate profile pages for each of the team members.


Day Four we continued to work on our blog web sites. As the day went on we improved the speed at which we could use git hub to manage our project.
