I want to talk about Git, simply put, It is one of the most important tools a programmer needs to learn. The team at Founders & Coders know this, and have made week 1 revolve around it.

>`$git clone `  
>`$git checkout -b branch`  
>`$git branch -d branch`  
>`$git add .`  
>`$git commit -m "comment"`  
>`git push origin branch`  
>`git pull origin master`  
>`git merge master`

These commands may look alien to you if you are yet to tackle Git, they may look too simple if you are already a programmer, our first week has revolved around getting a hang of not just how these commands work, but when, and in which order they should be used.  

After 5 days, I can safely say that I have conquered the very basics of git, and this is not because I've read a lot of books or completed some fantastic tutorials: [Intro to Git](https://github.com/NataliaLKB/learn-git-basics). It is because I have spent a majority of the last few days using git, and that is what I will recommend to anyone who wants to nail down the basics of git.

One thing I will before you get started, find a partner. Git is one of the easiest things to do on your own, but it's when you are part of a team and you come across and resolve a `git merge conflict`, will you truly understand the basics of Git
